# My first large React+NodeJs application

This is my course project as a trainee in company ITransition.

## Description

This is a low-end clone of Metacritic website. Authorized users can create reviews (on books, films, etc) and create comments and likes.

All website visitors are allowed to see all reviews on the main page. The full text search and other filtering stuff is implemented. Also it is possible to visit someones profile and see his/her total amount of likes and all written posts.

**You can try this app [here](https://megacritic.herokuapp.com/), but you probably should wait for a few seconds to start a server**
